# Assignment 1: Elevator Simulations
## Overview
This is an elevator simulation system. It contains 2 different types of passenger generating system and 3 different elevator movement system. For more details, see:
https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc148h/fall/assignments/a1/handout/a1.html
(University of Toronto does not ask for "extra features" to show my skill, so what I did is exactly what the handout asked for. )

## Features
- The basic entities contained in the simulation: people and elevators.
- The update algorithms that determine how the entities change over time (how new people appear in the simulation, how elevators decide to move across floors).
- The main runner of the simulation, which is responsible for setting up the initial parameters of the simulation, running the simulation, determining when the simulation should end, and reporting the results of the simulation.
- With the hlep of pygame module, visualize the simulation process.  

## Known issues:
None. My code is perfect. :/
